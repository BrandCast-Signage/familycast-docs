# Managing Your Usage

Keep track of your FamilyCast usage and make the most of your plan - whether Free, Family Plus, or Family Max.

## Overview

Every FamilyCast plan includes limits for:
- **Displays** - Screens showing your family info
- **Storage** - Space for photos and videos
- **Family Members** - Who can manage content
- **Content Items** - Widgets, calendars, photos
- **Integrations** - Connected services

Don't worry - we'll help you stay within your limits and make the most of what you have!

## Checking Your Usage

### Usage Dashboard

Find your usage anytime:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Usage**
2. See colorful bars showing usage
3. Green = plenty of room
4. Yellow = getting full
5. Red = almost at limit

**Example View:**
```
Displays:     1 of 1 used  ████████████ 100%
Storage:      250MB of 1GB ███░░░░░░░░░  25%
Content:      3 of 4 items ████████░░░░  75%
