## Troubleshooting

### Calendar Not Syncing

1. Integration still connected (not expired)
2. Calendar actually has events
3. Date range includes events
4. Events not filtered out

**Solutions:**

- Verify events exist in source calendar (Cozi/Google)
- Wait up to 15 minutes for sync
- Check calendar filter settings

### Events Missing

**Common Causes:**
- Events outside displayed date range
- Filtered calendar not selected
- Event privacy settings (private events hidden)
- Recurring event exception

**Solutions:**
- Expand date range in calendar settings
- Verify all desired calendars are selected
- Check event privacy in source calendar
- Recreate recurring event if broken

### Colors Not Showing

**Issue:** All events same color or wrong colors

**Solutions:**
- Verify color assignments in integration settings
- Re-sync calendar connection
- Check source calendar has colors set
- Manually assign colors in FamilyCast

### Calendar Too Small to Read

**Solutions:**
- Increase calendar area size in layout
- Use day or agenda view instead of month
- Larger display device
- Reduce number of visible calendars
- Filter to essential events only
