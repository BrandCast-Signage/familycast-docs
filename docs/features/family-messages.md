# Family Messages

:::info Coming Soon
Family Messages is planned for a future release. We're designing a family messaging system based on feedback from early users.

**What we're planning:**
- Leave notes and reminders for family members
- Schedule messages for specific times
- Send to specific displays or all family members
- Read receipts when messages are seen

**Current alternatives:**
- Use shared Google Calendar events for reminders
- Add text content to displays manually
- Use Cozi lists for to-do items

**Want this feature sooner?**
Contact us at hello@familycast.app to express interest and share your use case. Your feedback helps us prioritize features.

### Targeting
- Send to specific child's display

## Why Not Available Yet?

We're a small team focused on core features first:
