# Gmail Integration

:::caution Third-Party Verification In Progress
The Gmail integration is currently undergoing third-party security verification required by Google. While the feature is built and ready, we cannot enable it for customers until Google completes their OAuth app verification process.

**Expected Timeline:** We've submitted our application for verification and expect approval within 4-8 weeks.

**Want to be notified?** Email hello@familycast.app to get on the waitlist for early access once verification is complete.

Display AI-generated actionable items from your Gmail inbox on your digital displays. Perfect for staying on top of important emails without constant inbox checking.

## Overview

The Gmail integration uses AI to scan your recent emails and extract actionable items - things that need your attention, responses, or action. It displays these items prioritized by urgency, helping teams stay organized.

**What It Shows:**
- Actionable items from recent emails (deadlines, required actions, notifications)
- Priority levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Sender information (privacy-aware)
- Unread email count

**What It Doesn't Show:**
- Full email content
- Personal/sensitive information (redacted by AI)
- Email bodies or attachments

## Setup

### Step 1: Connect Gmail

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Click **Gmail**
3. Click **Connect Gmail**
4. Sign in with your Google account
5. Allow BrandCast to access Gmail (read-only)

**Permissions Required:**
- `gmail.readonly` - Read emails only (never sends or modifies)

### Step 2: Configure Email Summary

**Labels to Include:**
- Default: INBOX
- Add custom labels: Work, Important, etc.
- Exclude: SPAM, TRASH

**Privacy Level:**
- **Low** - Show sender names and subjects
- **Medium** - Show sender names only (default)
- **High** - Show initials only

**Refresh Interval:**
- 15 minutes (default)
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour

**Max Items to Display:**
- 5 items (compact)
- 10 items (default)
- 20 items (detailed)

## How It Works

### AI Processing

1. **Fetches recent emails** (last 50 by default)
2. **AI analyzes emails** for actionable content
3. **Extracts items** (deadlines, tasks, notifications)
4. **Prioritizes** by urgency (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
5. **Redacts sensitive info** (emails, phones, SSN, credit cards)
6. **Displays clean summary** on your screen

### Privacy & Security

**What Gets Redacted:**
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Social Security numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Personal identifiers

**Data Storage:**
- OAuth tokens stored securely
- Email content NOT stored
- AI summaries cached for 15 minutes
- No email forwarding or sending

**Who Can See:**
- Only users with access to the display
- Not suitable for public displays with sensitive emails
- Best for office/team environments

- Verify labels are correct
- Ensure emails in timeframe (last 50)

**Too many items:**
- Reduce "Max Items" setting
- Adjust labels to focus on specific folders
- Use label exclusions

**Privacy concerns:**
- Increase privacy level to "High"
- Use label filtering to exclude sensitive folders
- Consider separate display account for sensitive emails

**Items not updating:**
- Check refresh interval setting
- Verify OAuth token hasn't expired
- Reconnect Gmail if needed

## Limitations

- **Gmail only** - No Outlook, Yahoo, or other providers yet
- **Read-only** - Cannot send, delete, or modify emails
- **AI dependent** - Summary quality depends on AI availability
- **English only** - Best results with English emails
