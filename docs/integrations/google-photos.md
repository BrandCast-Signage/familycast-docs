## Album Management

### Creating Albums in Google Photos

**Best Practice: Create FamilyCast-Specific Albums**

**In Google Photos App:**

1. Open Google Photos
2. Go to **Albums**
3. Click **Create Album**
4. Name it: "FamilyCast - Living Room" (or similar)
5. Add 50-100 photos
6. Save album

**Why Dedicated Albums:**
- Control exactly what displays show
- Easy content curation
- Different albums for different displays
- Keep private photos separate

### Album Naming Strategy

**Effective Names:**
- "FamilyCast - Kitchen" (location-specific)
- "FamilyCast - Kids Safe" (appropriate for kids' displays)
- "FamilyCast - Recent 3 Months" (time-based)
- "FamilyCast - Favorites" (quality-curated)
- "FamilyCast - Travel" (theme-based)

**Avoid:**
- Generic names ("Photos", "Album 1")
- No indication of content
- Duplicate names

### Curating Photo Content

**Photo Selection Tips:**

**Include:**
- ✅ Mix of people and places
- ✅ Variety of events and everyday moments
- ✅ Extended family members
- ✅ Pets and family activities
- ✅ Landscapes from vacations
- ✅ Happy, positive memories

**Exclude:**
- ❌ Blurry or poorly lit photos
- ❌ Duplicate similar shots
- ❌ Embarrassing photos (especially for kids)
- ❌ Work-related photos
- ❌ Private moments
- ❌ Photos with non-family members (privacy)

**How Many Photos:**
- **Minimum**: 20-30 (avoid repetition)
- **Recommended**: 50-100 (good variety)
- **Large Album**: 200-500 (extensive rotation)
- **Max**: 1000+ (very slow sync, consider splitting)

**Update Frequency:**
- **Monthly**: Add new favorites from recent events
- **Quarterly**: Remove outdated or seasonal photos
- **Annually**: Major album refresh
- **After Events**: Add vacation/event photos immediately

## Best Practices

- Mix both if display can rotate

**Lighting & Quality:**
- Bright, clear photos work best

- **Summer**: Vacations, pool, beach, BBQs
- **Fall**: Back to school, autumn colors, Halloween
- **Winter**: Holidays, snow, cozy indoor moments

**Memory Themes:**
- "This Month Last Year" (time machine)
- "Throwback Decades" (90s, 2000s, 2010s)
- "New Memories" (last month)
- "All-Time Favorites" (best ever)

### Privacy & Safety

**Review Before Sharing:**
