# Photo Slideshows - Turn Your Displays into Dynamic Photo Frames

Transform any FamilyCast display into a beautiful, ever-changing photo gallery. Show family memories, kids' artwork, vacation photos, and special moments throughout your home.

## What Are Photo Slideshows?

Photo slideshows let you display a rotating collection of images on your FamilyCast screens. Unlike static photo frames, slideshows automatically cycle through your chosen photos, keeping your displays fresh and engaging.

**Perfect For:**
- 📸 Family photo galleries (vacations, holidays, everyday moments)
- 🎨 Kids' artwork rotation (showcase their creativity)
- 🎉 Birthday and celebration memories
- 👵 Grandparents' photo displays (rotating grandkids photos)
- 🏡 Home memory walls (digital scrapbooks)
- 🎓 Milestone celebrations (graduations, achievements)

**Available in:** All FamilyCast plans (Free, Standard, Premium)

## Why Families Love Slideshows

### Bring Memories to Life

Instead of choosing just one photo for a frame, display hundreds of your family's best moments. Relive vacations during breakfast, see the kids' artwork while cooking dinner, or enjoy memories of loved ones in the living room.

### Celebrate Everyone

Create slideshows for each family member's room showing their personal photos, rotate through extended family photos in shared spaces, or dedicate a display to grandparents' photos to brighten their day.

### Keep It Fresh

Automatically rotate through seasonal photos, add new memories from recent events, and never see the same photo twice in days (with large collections).

### Mix Content Sources

Combine photos from Google Photos, directly uploaded kids' drawings, printed photos you've scanned, and even family recipe cards or handwritten notes.

### Shuffle vs. Chronological Order

**Shuffle (Random):**
- ✅ Every viewing is different
- ✅ Keeps display feeling fresh
- ✅ Good for large collections
- ✅ Less predictable (more surprising)
- ❌ No narrative flow
- ❌ May show old + new photos next to each other

**Best For:** Daily family displays, large collections

**Chronological (Oldest to Newest):**
- ✅ Tells a story over time
- ✅ See kids growing up in order
- ✅ Seasonal flow (summer → fall → winter)
- ✅ Predictable pattern
- ❌ Same order every time
- ❌ Can feel repetitive

**Best For:** Milestone displays, "year in review" slideshows

**Reverse Chronological (Newest First):**
- ✅ See recent photos first
- ✅ Older photos after
- ✅ Good for Google Photos "recent" albums

**Best For:** Always-current displays

**Family Recommendation:** Shuffle for daily displays, Chronological for special occasion displays

---

### Photo Fit Options - How Photos Fill the Screen

**Fill Screen:**
- **Result**: Entire screen filled, no black bars
- **Trade-off**: Photos may be cropped slightly
- **Best For**: Professional look, no distractions
- **When to Use**: Most family displays

**Fit to Screen:**
- **Result**: Entire photo visible, may have black bars on sides
- **Trade-off**: Black bars on portrait photos
- **Best For**: Preserving full photo composition
- **When to Use**: Artwork, important photos where cropping isn't acceptable

**Original Size:**
- **Result**: Photo displayed at actual resolution
- **Trade-off**: May be too small or too large for screen
- **Best For**: Technical accuracy (rarely needed)
- **When to Use**: Almost never for family displays

**Family Recommendation:** Fill Screen (looks best)

---

### Ken Burns Effect (Zoom + Pan)

**What It Is:**
Slow, subtle zoom in and pan across photos (like documentaries)

**Settings:**
- **Speed**: Slow (15 seconds), Medium (10 sec), Fast (5 sec)
- **Zoom Level**: 110% (subtle) to 150% (dramatic)
- **Pan Direction**: Random or fixed

**Best For:**

- Landscape/scenery photos
- Portrait photos (close-ups)
- Living room displays (cinematic feel)

**Avoid With:**
- Low-resolution photos (pixelates when zoomed)
- Busy photos (zoom makes them harder to see)
- Text-heavy content (recipe cards, signs)
- Very fast durations (disorienting)

**Family Recommendation:** Enable for curated "favorites" collections, disable for everyday displays

---

### How Many Photos?

**Small Collection (20-30 photos):**
- **Pros**: Carefully curated, all high-quality
- **Cons**: Repetitive, see same photos often
- **Best For**: Special event displays (birthday, vacation)
- **Duration**: 15-20 seconds per photo (stretch viewing time)

**Medium Collection (50-100 photos - Recommended):**
- **Pros**: Good variety, not repetitive, manageable
- **Cons**: Still requires curation
- **Best For**: Most family displays
- **Duration**: 10-15 seconds per photo

**Large Collection (200-500 photos):**
- **Pros**: Tons of variety, rarely repetitive
- **Cons**: May include lower-quality photos, slower sync
- **Best For**: "All Family Photos" displays, long-term displays
- **Duration**: 5-10 seconds per photo (more to show)

**Very Large (1000+ photos):**
- **Pros**: Never repetitive
- **Cons**: Very slow sync, hard to curate, may overwhelm
- **Best For**: Digital photo frame replacing printed albums
- **Recommendation**: Use Google Photos filters (last 6 months, people, etc.)

---

### Organizing Photos in Google Photos

**Create Dedicated FamilyCast Albums:**

Instead of syncing entire library, create purpose-specific albums:

**"FamilyCast - Kitchen" Album:**
- Last 3 months of photos
- Everyday moments + special events
- 75-100 photos
- Update monthly

**"FamilyCast - Kids Safe" Album:**
- G-rated, age-appropriate
- Family activities
- Kids' friends and school events (with permission)
- No embarrassing content

**"FamilyCast - All-Time Favorites" Album:**
- Curated best 100 photos ever
- Major milestones
- Extended family
- Oldest to newest

**"FamilyCast - Grandparents" Shared Album:**
- Grandkids' recent photos
- Everyone in family can contribute
- Update weekly

---

### Mixing Photo Sources Effectively

**Combine for Best Results:**

**Example: Kitchen Display Slideshow**
- 60 photos from Google Photos (recent family photos)
- 15 kids' drawings (direct upload)
- 5 Google Slides (recipes, weekly schedule)
- **Total**: 80 items, 10 seconds each = 13 minutes before repeat

**Example: Kids' Room Display**
- 30 photos from "Emma's Photos" album
- 20 pieces of Emma's artwork (uploaded)
- 5 Google Slides (achievement certificates, awards)
- **Total**: 55 items, 15 seconds each = 14 minutes before repeat

**Balance Sources:**
- 70% Google Photos (automatic sync, low maintenance)
- 20% Direct uploads (artwork, special items)
- 10% Google Slides (structured content, captions)

---

### Updating Slideshow Content

**Monthly Maintenance:**
- Add new favorites from recent events
- Remove outdated photos (old news, past events)
- Update seasonal content (winter → spring)
- Refresh kids' artwork with new pieces

**Quarterly Deep Clean:**
- Review entire collection
- Remove duplicates or similar shots
- Add archived favorites (old photos you forgot about)
- Reorganize albums by theme

**After Big Events:**
- Add vacation photos immediately
- Update birthday child's slideshow
- Add holiday photos while still relevant

**Set Reminders:**
- "Update kitchen slideshow" - 1st of each month
- "Refresh all displays" - Start of each season
- "Add recent photos" - After family events

---

### Performance & Loading Speed

**Keep Slideshows Running Smoothly:**

**Photo Resolution:**
- 1920x1080 (Full HD) ideal for most displays
- 4K photos work but load slower
- Compress large photos before upload (use Google Photos automatic compression)

**File Sizes:**
- Target: 500KB - 2MB per photo
- Max: 5MB per photo
- Use JPG for photos (PNG only for graphics with transparency)

**Collection Size:**
- Optimal: 50-100 photos per slideshow
- Max recommended: 200-300 photos
- Very large collections (500+) may have slower initial load

**Internet Speed:**
- Google Photos requires 5+ Mbps for smooth loading
- Direct uploads are cached locally (faster)
- Slow connection? Use smaller collections or lower-quality setting

---

## Troubleshooting

### Slideshow Not Playing

**Check These:**

1. **Content Added to Slideshow?**
   - Open layout editor
   - Verify slideshow area has content assigned
   - Check that albums/uploads are selected

2. **Display Online?**
   - Go to **Displays** in dashboard
   - Check display status (should be green "Online")
   - Refresh the display browser if offline

3. **Layout Assigned?**
   - Verify display has active layout assigned
   - Check that slideshow area is visible (not hidden or zero size)

4. **Photos Actually Available?**
   - Google Photos: Check sync completed
   - Direct uploads: Verify files uploaded successfully
   - Check **Content Library** to confirm photos exist

**Solutions:**
- Reassign layout to display
- Force sync Google Photos (**Integrations** → **Sync Now**)
- Refresh display browser (Ctrl+F5)
- Check display connection status

---

### Photos Not Showing (Blank Screen or Black Squares)

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Google Photos Not Synced:**
   - Go to **Integrations** → **Google Photos**
   - Check sync status and last sync time
   - Click **Sync Now** to force immediate sync

2. **Photos Not in Selected Album:**
   - Verify photos are IN the album FamilyCast is syncing
   - Photos in library but not in album won't show
   - Add photos to album in Google Photos

3. **Broken Image URLs (URL imports):**
   - Check if URL is still accessible
   - Re-import photo if URL changed
   - Use direct uploads instead

4. **Permissions Issue (Google Photos):**
   - Reconnect Google Photos account
   - Grant all requested permissions
   - Verify album is accessible (not deleted)

---

### Slideshow Not Advancing (Stuck on One Photo)

**Check:**

1. **Auto-advance Enabled?**
   - Edit layout
   - Click slideshow area
   - Verify **Auto-advance** is ON

2. **Duration Set Too Long?**
   - Check slide duration setting
   - Should be 5-30 seconds (not minutes)

3. **Only One Photo in Slideshow?**
   - Verify multiple photos selected
   - Add more content to slideshow

4. **Browser Frozen?**
   - Refresh display browser
   - Check device performance (old tablet may struggle)

**Solutions:**
- Enable auto-advance in slideshow settings
- Set reasonable duration (10-15 seconds)
- Refresh display browser

---

### Photos Cropped Incorrectly (Important Parts Cut Off)

**Cause:** Portrait photos on landscape display, or vice versa

**Solutions:**

1. **Change Photo Fit Setting:**
   - Edit layout → Slideshow settings
   - Change **Photo Fit** to "Fit to Screen"
   - Accept black bars to see full photo

2. **Use Correct Orientation Photos:**
   - Landscape photos (horizontal) for most displays
   - Portrait photos (vertical) only if display is portrait-mounted
   - Filter out wrong orientation in Google Photos

3. **Crop Photos in Google Photos:**
   - Edit photos to 16:9 aspect ratio before syncing
   - Ensure important content is in center of frame
   - Use safe zones (avoid important content at edges)

4. **Mount Display Differently:**
   - If mostly portrait photos, mount display vertically
   - FamilyCast auto-rotates layout to match display orientation

---

### Google Photos Not Syncing (New Photos Not Appearing)

**Check:**

1. **Last Sync Time:**
   - **Integrations** → **Google Photos**
   - "Last Synced" should be within 6 hours
   - If longer, may be connection issue

2. **Photos in Synced Album?**
   - Verify you added photos to album FamilyCast is syncing
   - Not just in library - must be in album

3. **Integration Still Connected?**
   - Check connection status (green "Connected")
   - If red "Disconnected", reconnect account

4. **Sync Interval:**
   - Automatic sync: Every 6 hours
   - Manual sync: Click **Sync Now** for immediate update

**Solutions:**
- Click **Sync Now** to force update
- Reconnect Google Photos account
- Verify photos in correct album
- Wait 6 hours for automatic sync

---

### Duplicate Photos Appearing (Same Photo Multiple Times)

**Cause:** Photo appears in multiple synced albums

**How FamilyCast Handles Duplicates:**
- Each album's photos are treated separately
- If photo is in 2 synced albums, it may appear twice

**Solutions:**

1. **Remove from Duplicate Albums:**
   - Check which albums are synced
   - Remove duplicate photo from one album

2. **Sync Only One Album per Display:**
   - Instead of syncing multiple albums to one display
   - Assign only one primary album
   - Reduces duplicate likelihood

3. **Use Filters:**
   - If using "All Photos" or multiple albums
   - Enable de-duplication in slideshow settings
   - FamilyCast will show each photo only once

### Slideshow Loading Slowly or Stuttering

**Causes:**

1. **Slow Internet Connection:**
   - Google Photos streams photos from cloud
   - Requires 5+ Mbps for smooth playback
   - Test speed: speedtest.net

2. **High-Resolution Photos:**
   - 4K photos (3840x2160) are large files
   - Take longer to load than 1080p
   - May stutter on older displays

3. **Old/Slow Display Device:**
   - Older tablets or Fire TV Sticks struggle
   - Ken Burns effect requires processing power
   - Too many photos in queue

**Solutions:**

1. **Lower Photo Quality:**
   - **Display Settings** → **Photo Quality**: Medium or Low
   - Faster loading, less bandwidth usage
   - Still looks great on most displays

2. **Smaller Photo Collections:**
   - 50-100 photos instead of 500+
   - Faster initial load
   - Smoother playback

3. **Simplify Transitions:**
   - Use Fade instead of Zoom (Ken Burns)
   - Less processing required
   - Smoother on older devices

4. **Use Direct Uploads Instead:**
   - Upload photos to FamilyCast directly
   - Cached locally (faster)
   - No streaming from cloud

5. **Upgrade Display Device:**
   - Modern devices handle high-res photos better
   - Fire TV 4K, newer tablets recommended

### Wrong Photos Showing (Unexpected Content)

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Wrong Album Synced:**
   - Double-check which albums are synced
   - May have selected wrong album
   - Go to **Integrations** → **Google Photos** to verify

2. **"All Photos" Setting:**
   - If set to sync "all albums"
   - Will show everything in library
   - Change to specific albums only

3. **Shared Album with Unwanted Content:**
   - Someone else added photos to shared album
   - Review album contents in Google Photos
   - Remove unwanted photos or stop syncing that album

**Solutions:**
- Verify correct album assigned to display
- Use specific albums, not "All Photos"
- Review and curate album contents
- Remove unwanted photos from album in Google Photos
