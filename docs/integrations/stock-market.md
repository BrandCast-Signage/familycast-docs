**When Stocks Go Down:**

- "What's the difference between a dip and a crash?"

**Comparing Stocks:**

### Age-Appropriate Lessons

**Ages 8-12:**
- Track companies they know (Disney, Apple, Nike)

- Calculate percentage changes
- Research why stocks move
- Compare different companies

**Ages 16-18:**
- Understand market indices
- Learn about diversification

## Understanding the Numbers

### Stock Price
**What It Means:**
- Current price per share
- How much one "piece" of company costs
- Example: AAPL $150.25 = One share costs $150.25

**Teaching Tip:**
"If you wanted to own a tiny piece of Apple, you'd pay $150.25. If Apple does well, that piece becomes worth more."

### Price Change
**What It Means:**
- How much stock moved today
- Shown in dollars and percentages
- Example: ▲ +2.50 (+1.69%)
- Green arrow = up, Red arrow = down

**Teaching Tip:**
"The stock went up $2.50 today. That's a 1.69% gain. If you owned 10 shares, you'd have $25 more."

### Market Indices
**What They Mean:**
- Average of many companies
- Shows overall market health
- ^GSPC (S&P 500) = 500 biggest US companies

**Teaching Tip:**
"The S&P 500 shows how 500 big companies are doing together. If it's up, most companies are doing well."

### Market Cap (Market Capitalization)
**What It Means:**
- Total company value
- Price per share × number of shares
- Example: Apple ~$2.5 trillion

**Teaching Tip:**
"Market cap is what everyone together thinks the company is worth. Apple is worth about $2.5 trillion—bigger than most countries' economies!"

## When the Market is Open

**US Stock Market Hours:**
- **Market Open**: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time
- **Days**: Monday - Friday
- **Closed**: Weekends and market holidays

**What Happens When Market is Closed:**

**Teaching Opportunity:**
"Markets are only open during business hours on weekdays, just like many stores. After 4pm, trading stops until tomorrow."

**Market Holidays:**
- New Year's Day
- Martin Luther King Jr. Day
- Presidents Day

## Troubleshooting

### Prices Not Updating

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Market is closed** - Check if it's after 4pm Eastern or weekend
2. **Update interval too long** - Change to 5-10 minutes in settings
3. **No internet connection** - Check your display's WiFi

**Solutions:**
- Verify current time and market hours
- Reduce update interval
- Test internet connection
- Refresh the display

### Stock Symbol Not Found

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Typo in symbol** - APPL instead of AAPL
2. **Company changed ticker** - Mergers, acquisitions
3. **International stock** - Need exchange suffix

**Solutions:**
- Double-check symbol on Yahoo Finance or Google
- Use correct format (AAPL, not Apple)
- For indices, include ^ prefix (^DJI, ^GSPC)
- Update to current ticker if company changed

### Chart Not Showing

**Possible Causes:**
1. **New company** - Not enough historical data
2. **Invalid time range** - Stock hasn't existed that long
3. **Display too small** - Chart needs minimum size

**Solutions:**
- Try shorter time range (1 day instead of 1 year)
- Verify stock is active and trading
- Increase content area size
- Test with well-known symbol (AAPL)

### Too Many Stocks (Overwhelming)

**Problem:**
- Ticker scrolls too fast
- Kids can't focus on individual stocks
- Information overload

**Solutions:**
- Reduce to 5-10 stocks maximum
- Use Card style instead of Ticker
- Create separate watchlists (one for learning, one for tracking)
- Start with just major indices

## Privacy and Safety

### Financial Privacy

**What's Shown:**
- Stock prices (public information)
- Your selected watchlist (what you choose to track)
- Percentage changes

**What's NOT Shown:**
- How many shares you own
- Your account balances
- Personal investment details
- Your actual money

**Teaching Privacy:**
- Explain that actual investment amounts are private
- Use virtual portfolios for teaching
- Keep real financial details separate
- Model good privacy practices

### Age-Appropriate Content

**For Younger Kids (8-12):**
- Focus on companies they know
- Keep explanations simple
- Use as occasional educational tool
- Don't stress about daily changes

**For Teens (13-18):**
- More detailed discussions
- Connect to economics and math
- Discuss real news and events
- Consider actual investment (with parents)

**General Guidelines:**
- Markets can be stressful—keep it light
- Focus on learning, not winning/losing
- Use as one tool among many
- Don't let it cause anxiety

## Best Practices for Families

### Keep It Simple

**Start Small:**
- Begin with 3-5 stocks
- Add more as kids get interested
- Don't overwhelm with data
- Make it accessible, not intimidating

**Focus on Learning:**
- Educational tool first
- Not investment advice
- Use for conversations
- Connect to real life

### Make It Relevant

**Choose Relatable Companies:**
- Brands your family uses
- Companies kids recognize
- Local businesses if public
- Mix of sectors (tech, retail, entertainment)

**Connect to Daily Life:**
- "We're shopping at Target—it's a public company!"
- "Your Xbox is from Microsoft—they're on our tracker"
- "That movie is Disney—let's see how their stock is doing"

### Use as Teaching Tool

**Weekly Family Check-In:**
- Review stocks together
- Discuss what moved and why
- Research one company
- Connect to news and events

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Why do you think this stock went up/down?"
- "What news might affect this company?"
- "Which of these companies would you invest in?"
- "How is this company doing compared to last month?"

### Set Appropriate Expectations

**Teach These Principles:**
- Markets go up and down—that's normal
- Investing is long-term, not day-to-day
- Diversification reduces risk
- Research before investing real money
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

**Avoid These Pitfalls:**
- Getting stressed over daily changes
- Treating it like gambling
- Focusing only on winners
- Ignoring the learning in favor of "making money"
