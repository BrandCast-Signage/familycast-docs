# Pricing & Plans

:::warning BETA Pricing
FamilyCast is currently in beta. Pricing is subject to change as we refine our product based on family feedback. Early adopters will be notified of any pricing changes with 30 days notice.
:::

Simple, family-friendly pricing. One flat rate for up to 3 displays, then add more as you need them.

## How FamilyCast Pricing Works

FamilyCast uses **flat-rate pricing** that's easy to understand. Perfect for families who don't want to do math.

### Pricing

| Plan Component | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Base Plan** | **$9/month** | Up to 3 displays anywhere in your home |
| **Extra Displays** | **+$3/month each** | 4th display and beyond |

### Examples

- **Getting started** (1 display): **$9/month**
- **Typical family** (3 displays): **$9/month**
- **Large home** (5 displays): $9 + (2 × $3) = **$15/month**
- **Multi-generational** (7 displays): $9 + (4 × $3) = **$21/month**

## What's Included

### Every Family Gets:

- **Up to 3 displays** included in base price
- **Unlimited family members** - Everyone can help manage
- **All family integrations** - Cozi, Google Calendar, Google Photos, and more
- **1GB photo storage** - Store hundreds of family photos
- **Safe for kids** - Age-appropriate content controls
- **No ads** - Your family content only
- **Email support** - Get help when you need it
- **Regular updates** - New features added monthly

### Storage

- **Included:** 1GB total for all family photos and content
- **Extra storage:** $1/GB per month if you need more

(Unlike BrandCast which gives 2GB per display, FamilyCast gives a family-sized 1GB total that's plenty for most households)

## Adding More Displays

Start with the base plan and add displays to more rooms:

**1-3 displays:** $9/month (no extra cost)
- Kitchen command center
- Kids' bedroom
- Living room

**4+ displays:** Add $3/month for each additional display
- 4th display: $9 + $3 = $12/month
- 5th display: $9 + $6 = $15/month
- 6th display: $9 + $9 = $18/month

### Example Family Setups

**Busy family of 4:**
- Kitchen (main calendar)
- Kids' shared bedroom (chore chart)
- Parents' bedroom (schedule)
= 3 displays = **$9/month**

**Multi-generational home:**
- Kitchen (family calendar)
- Kids' room 1 (homework tracker)
- Kids' room 2 (sports schedule)
- Parents' bedroom (meal planning)
- Grandparents' suite (photo slideshow)
= 5 displays = **$15/month**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is there really no free tier?**
Correct. FamilyCast starts at $9/month for up to 3 displays. We're a small, bootstrapped family business and need revenue to keep building great features for families.

**How many displays can I have?**
As many as you want! Base price includes 3 displays, then $3/month for each additional display.

**Can my kids help manage the displays?**
Absolutely! On FamilyCast, kids can have supervised accounts to update their own displays (with parent approval).

**What if we only need 1 display?**
$9/month includes up to 3 displays, so you're covered even if you only use one. As your family grows, you can add more.

**Do both parents pay separately?**
No! One family subscription covers everyone. Both parents (and kids) can log in and manage displays under one account.

**What happens to our photos if we cancel?**
You have 30 days to download all your photos and content. We never delete your family memories immediately.

**Can we use FamilyCast at our vacation home?**
Each subscription is for one primary home. Contact us if you need displays at multiple properties - we can work something out!

**How is this different from BrandCast?**
BrandCast is for businesses with pay-per-display pricing. FamilyCast is for families with simple flat-rate pricing and family-focused features (Cozi, kid-safe content, chore charts, etc.).

**Can I pause during summer when kids are at camp?**
Yes! Deactivate your displays during summer and you'll only pay for storage. Reactivate when school starts again.

## Why We Charge

We're a small, bootstrapped team building software for families. Unlike big tech companies, we don't:
- Sell your family data
- Show ads on your displays
- Track you across the web

Instead, we charge a fair price for software that helps families stay organized. Your subscription helps us:
- Keep building new features
- Provide great support
- Maintain reliable service
- Respect your family's privacy

We think $9/month for a family command center is a fair trade.
