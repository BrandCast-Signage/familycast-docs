## Important: Kiosk Mode Challenges on Android

**Android tablet kiosk mode varies significantly by manufacturer.** Unlike iPads (with built-in Guided Access) or Fire Tablets (with launcher control), Android tablets require third-party solutions or Android Enterprise configuration.

### Kiosk Mode Options

**Option A: Third-Party Kiosk App (RECOMMENDED for most users)**
- Use apps like **Fully Kiosk Browser** or **Kiosk Browser Lockdown**
- Easiest for single-device setups
- $15-30 one-time license per device
- Works on most Android tablets

**Option B: Android Enterprise (for tech-savvy users)**
- Requires Android Enterprise enrollment
- More complex setup
- Free but requires Google account and configuration
- Best if you're comfortable with device management

**Option C: Manual Configuration (NOT RECOMMENDED)**
- No true kiosk mode, relies on hiding apps
- Not secure, easy to accidentally exit
- Only suitable if tablet is in low-traffic area

**This guide covers Option A (Third-Party Kiosk App) using Fully Kiosk Browser as the recommended solution.**
