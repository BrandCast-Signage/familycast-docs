# Hardware Setup Guides

FamilyCast works with a wide variety of devices, from affordable Fire Tablets to professional-grade iPads and computers. This section provides step-by-step setup guides for each supported platform.

## Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

One of FamilyCast's biggest advantages is **BYOD support**—you can use devices you already own instead of buying expensive proprietary hardware. This can save you **40-60% on hardware costs** compared to traditional family organization solutions.

### Supported Devices

- **[Amazon Fire Tablets](./fire-tablet-setup.md)** - Best value for kitchen or entryway displays ($80+)
- **[Apple iPads](./ipad-setup.md)** - Premium quality for living spaces ($250+)
- **[Android Tablets](./android-tablet-setup.md)** - Flexible options across price points ($100-400)
- **[Raspberry Pi](./raspberry-pi-byod-setup.md)** - For customers who already own Pi hardware ($35+)
- **[Computers](./computer-setup.md)** - Windows, Mac, or Linux for office or bedroom displays

### BYOD vs. Complete Kits

**Use BYOD When:**
- ✅ You have existing tablets or computers gathering dust
- ✅ You want to minimize upfront hardware costs
- ✅ You're comfortable with basic tech setup (15-30 minutes per device)
- ✅ You're starting small and want to test before scaling

**Use Complete Kits When:**
- ✅ You want plug-and-play setup (5 minutes)
- ✅ You need warranty support on all hardware
- ✅ You're setting up multiple displays around your home
- ✅ You prefer vendor-managed hardware
